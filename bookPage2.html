            <p> A gripping historical novel about a spirited young girl who joins a sisterhood of Black women working together to undermine the Confederates—from the award-winning author of We Cast a Shadow

                The American Daughters follows Ady, a curious, sharp-witted girl who is enslaved alongside her mother, Sanite to a businessman in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Sanite and her mother Ady are an inseparable duo—taking walks along the river, working together in the fields and spending nights looking up at the stars, dreaming. Ady’s favorite pastime is listening to Sanite's stories of her families' origins, their fierce and rebellious nature, and the everlasting love that strengthens their bond.
                
                When mother and daughter are separated, Ady is left hopeless and unmoored, until she stumbles into the Mockingbird Inn and meets Lenore, a free Black woman with whom she becomes fast friends. Lenore invites Ady to join a clandestine society of spies called The Daughters. With the courage instilled in her by Sanite—and help from these strong women—Ady learns how to choose herself. So begins her journey toward liberation and imagining a new future. The American Daughters is a novel of hope and triumph that reminds us what is possible when a community bands together to fight for their right to live free.</p>

        <h3>I was expecting something better</h3>
        <p>I wasn’t expecting a slow moving coming of age story. The description of the book led me to believe that this would be about the American Daughters. They did not show up until the last third of the book. By then, I didn’t care anymore. I wasn’t enjoying this book, and I particularly disliked the narrator of the audiobook, so I gave up. I received a free copy of this book from the publisher.</p>

        <h3>Excellent</h3>
        <p>This is the first book I've read by this author. I picked it up because the description just sounded so interesting I couldn't pass it up.</p>

        <h3>Excellent</h3>
        <p>Interesting. I think Mr. Ruffin is now three for three. As he did in We Cast A Shadow, he writes with a confident witty prose that I find engaging and thusly the pages turn quickly. One salient question I have with every book, is why the title? So, here we don’t get the why of the title until we are at the 70% mark!</p>
